To use rotp, you have to have a Google Cloud Storage service:

	https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/getting-started

Before initiating your one time pass pad,
you should have the following information:

	* The name of an existing google store bucket to put your pad in.
	* The name of your pad.
	* Optionally, the name of a backup file in removable media (USB stick, SD Card, etc.).
	* The access key to your google cloud storage.
	* The secret key to your google cloud storage.
	* The master password you want to save.

Your intialization run will look something like the following:

	$ rotp --init TheBucketName ThePadName /media/1234-4567/cipher.pad
	Access Key: 
	YOURGOOGLEACCESSKEEY
	Secret Key: 
	YOURGOOGLESECRETKEYISHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE
	Password: 
	SuperSecretMasterPasswordVeryLongAndStoredInFireSafe
	SuperSecretMasterPasswordVeryLongAndStoredInFireSafe

You tell rotp that you're initiating a pad with the --init option.

I recommend you use the optional backup.
But either way be consistent.
If you specify a backup and it's not there at the time of regenearation,
regenaration will be skipped, keeping the backup valid for when it is available.
(So in that case, it would not be a one time pass.)
The backup is assumed to be the fast read and will be read instead of google storage.
If backup is unavalable or not given, google storage will be read.
Writes in regenaration are always done to google storage, and to backup if given.
Again, if a backup is given but is unavailable, regeneration is skipped.

So initialization is a really important step.
If a backup is given but unavailable,
the initialization will tell you and fail.

The advantage of having a backup is that you'll have your master password even if you're offline.
If you loose your backup media, you'll still be fine because
you can get your master password from google storage.

You get back your master password this way:

	rotp  ThePadName /media/1234-5678/cipher.pad
	Pin: 
	Sup
	SuperSecretMasterPasswordVeryLongAndStoredInFireSafe

All you have to remember is the first three charaters of your master password,
which is like a "pin number".  The first three letters of your master password is your pin.

You can change your master password:

	rotp --new TheBucketName ThePadName /media/1234-5678/cipher.pad
	Password: 
	AnotherVeryLongRidculouslyLongPasswordSavedInFireSafe
	AnotherVeryLongRidculouslyLongPasswordSavedInFireSafe

The --new option tells rotp to store a new password.
And check that's there:

	rotp TheBucketName ThePadName /media/1234-5678/cipher.pad
	Pin: 
	Ano
	AnotherVeryLongRidculouslyLongPasswordSavedInFireSafe

Here's what happens on a bad pin:

	rotp TheBucketName ThePadName /media/1234-56778/cipher.pad
	Pin: 
	NOP
	could not get password

The key files are stored in:
	~/.rotp
It's security is based primarily on the file system permissions, set to readable by the user only.
It contains your google access/secret keys.
The files are encrypted using your bucket name and pad name to create the encription key,
obfuscating attempts to get your google access keys (but not impossible...
if you have someone this far in your computer, you've got problems no matter what!).
